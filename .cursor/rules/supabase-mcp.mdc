# Supabase MCP Server

This document outlines the features and activation for the Supabase MCP server.

## Activation

To activate the Supabase MCP server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm dlx -y @supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest --project-ref soutjutstfwynuioiweg --read-only
```

## Tools

_**Note:** This server is pre-1.0, so expect some breaking changes between versions. Since LLMs will automatically adapt to the tools available, this shouldn't affect most users._

The following Supabase tools are available to the LLM:

### Project Management

_**Note:** these tools will be unavailable if the server is [scoped to a project](mdc:#project-scoped-mode)._

- `list_projects`: Lists all Supabase projects for the user.
- `get_project`: Gets details for a project.
- `create_project`: Creates a new Supabase project.
- `pause_project`: Pauses a project.
- `restore_project`: Restores a project.
- `list_organizations`: Lists all organizations that the user is a member of.
- `get_organization`: Gets details for an organization.

### Database Operations

- `list_tables`: Lists all tables within the specified schemas.
- `list_extensions`: Lists all extensions in the database.
- `list_migrations`: Lists all migrations in the database.
- `apply_migration`: Applies a SQL migration to the database. SQL passed to this tool will be tracked within the database, so LLMs should use this for DDL operations (schema changes).
- `execute_sql`: Executes raw SQL in the database. LLMs should use this for regular queries that don't change the schema.
- `get_logs`: Gets logs for a Supabase project by service type (api, postgres, edge functions, auth, storage, realtime). LLMs can use this to help with debugging and monitoring service performance.

### Edge Function Management

- `list_edge_functions`: Lists all Edge Functions in a Supabase project.
- `deploy_edge_function`: Deploys a new Edge Function to a Supabase project. LLMs can use this to deploy new functions or update existing ones.

### Project Configuration

- `get_project_url`: Gets the API URL for a project.
- `get_anon_key`: Gets the anonymous API key for a project.

### Branching (Experimental, requires a paid plan)

- `create_branch`: Creates a development branch with migrations from production branch.
- `list_branches`: Lists all development branches.
- `delete_branch`: Deletes a development branch.
- `merge_branch`: Merges migrations and edge functions from a development branch to production.
- `reset_branch`: Resets migrations of a development branch to a prior version.
- `rebase_branch`: Rebases development branch on production to handle migration drift.

### Development Tools

- `generate_typescript_types`: Generates TypeScript types based on the database schema. LLMs can save this to a file and use it in their code.

### Cost Confirmation

- `get_cost`: Gets the cost of a new project or branch for an organization.
- `confirm_cost`: Confirms the user's understanding of new project or branch costs. This is required to create a new project or branch.
